# Job Seach Project

## Introduction
This is a mobile-responsive front-end application that provides job postings to the seeker along with the current weather of the city of interest. The data is retrieved via two APIs, first is to GitHub for job postings ("https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?description=") and the second is to the wunderground ("https://api.wunderground.com/api/") for weather.  

## What the project does
This application creates an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app will take in an order from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, Materialize, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and Firebase.

## Requirements
* Must uses at least two APIs
* Must use AJAX to pull data  (AJAX method to put data)
* Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we haven’t discussed
* Must have a polished frontend / UI
* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
* Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals!)
* Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc)  <tbody> repeating elements
* Must use Bootstrap or Alternative CSS Framework
* Must be Deployed (GitHub Pages or Firebase)  (hosting on Firebase links to data easier)
* Must have User Input Validation

## Challenges
- Putting all the front-end technologies together took time in research and practice on how to use them correctly.
- Working on a team can be challanging.  Each member brings a different perspective to the table and can contribute in different ways.
